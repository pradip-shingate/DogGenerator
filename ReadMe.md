>I have used Kotlin for development because it reduces number of code lines and it has very good
feature of null safety and scoping functions.

>For developing this app I have used observer pattern. This is very easy to use pattern and good for small projects.

>For fetching dog details from server I have used OkHttp library reason is, It is very simple and easy to use
and parsing of data was not that complex and its good for small projects

>For image downloading I have used glide library.This is very efficient library than other libraries and also
 we can resize images using glide.

>I have used Lru cache to store bitmaps.

>To store bitmaps in persistence storage I have preferred SQLite Database because I am comfortable to use it
over other technics like Lru Disc cache.I could have use Lru Disk cache but the thing is, I never used it before in my any
project and learning about Lru Disk cache will take another more time.
